abstract: |
  This lecture explores the historical context of artificial intelligence through the lens of human limitations, embodiment, and our evolving understanding of intelligence and information. We trace the development of scientific thought, communication, computation, and automation, examining how these advancements have shaped our understanding of human intelligence and the challenges they present for AI. By understanding this history, we gain insights into what makes us uniquely human in the age of artificial intelligence.

\notes{As we conclude this historical journey, we see how our understanding of human intelligence, limitations, and our place in the universe has evolved alongside scientific and technological advancements. From ancient scribes to modern software engineers, from Newton's laws to quantum uncertainty, from early computing to modern AI, this perspective helps us appreciate what makes us uniquely human in the age of AI.}

\notes{The concept of Laplace's Gremlin reminds us that uncertainty is inherent in our world, and our methods of dealing with this uncertainty - through probability and statistics - are fundamental to both human reasoning and artificial intelligence.}

\notes{In our next lecture, we'll explore the philosophical implications of these historical developments and how they shape our concept of the "Atomic Human."}
