title: "The Atomic Human: Philosophy"
subtitle: "Philosophical Implications of AI and Human Intelligence"
abstract: |
  This lecture explores the philosophical questions raised by the development of artificial intelligence and our evolving understanding of human cognition. We examine key philosophical concepts related to intelligence, consciousness, and the nature of knowledge, and how these ideas are challenged and reshaped by advances in AI. By understanding these philosophical perspectives, we gain deeper insights into what it means to be human in the age of artificial intelligence.

\section{The Nature of Explanation in the Age of AI}

\include{_ai/includes/fit-models-to-fit-systems.md}

\notes{This transition from FIT models to FIT systems raises philosophical questions about the nature of explanation and understanding in complex AI systems.}

\section{Conclusion: The Atomic Human in Philosophical Context}

\notes{As we conclude this philosophical journey, we see how AI challenges and reshapes our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, knowledge, and what it means to be human. The concept of the "atomic human" emerges as a philosophical response to these challenges, emphasizing the unique aspects of human intelligence that persist even as AI capabilities expand.}

\notes{The philosophical questions raised by AI - about the nature of mind, the limits of knowledge, the ethics of artificial systems, and the future of human intelligence - will continue to be central to our understanding of both AI and ourselves. As we move forward, these philosophical considerations will be crucial in guiding the development and deployment of AI in ways that respect and enhance human values and capabilities.}

\notes{In our next lecture, we'll explore how these philosophical considerations translate into practical governance challenges in the age of AI.}
